# Age-specific risk factors for the prediction of obesity using a machine learning approach
### Abstract

Machine Learning is a powerful tool to discover hidden information and relationships in various data-driven research fields. Obesity is an extremely complex topic, involving biological, physiological, psychological, and environmental factors. One successful approach to the topic is machine learning frameworks, which can reveal complex and essential risk factors of obesity. Over the last two decades, the obese population (BMI of above 23) in Korea has grown. The purpose of this study is to identify risk factors that predict obesity using machine learning classifiers and identify the algorithm with the best accuracy among classifiers used for obesity prediction. This work will allow people to assess obesity risk from blood tests and blood pressure data based on the KNHANES, which used data constructed by the annual survey. Our data include a total of 21,100 participants (male 10,000 and female 11,100). We assess obesity prediction by utilizing six machine learning algorithms. We explore age- and gender-specific risk factors of obesity for adults (19–79 years old). Our results highlight the four most significant features in all age-gender groups for predicting obesity: triglycerides, ALT (SGPT), glycated hemoglobin, and uric acid. Our findings show that the risk factors for obesity are sensitive to age and gender under different machine learning algorithms. Performance is highest for the 19–39 age group of both genders, with over 70% accuracy and AUC, while the 60–79 age group shows around 65% accuracy and AUC. For the 40–59 age groups, the proposed algorithm achieved over 70% in AUC, but for the female participants, it achieved lower than 70% accuracy. For all classifiers and age groups, there is no big difference in the accuracy ratio when the number of features is more than six; however, the accuracy ratio decreased in the female 19–39 age group.
